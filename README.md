# Day 2 – Python Basics 🧠

This script helps users:
- Input their name and age
- Enter two numbers
- Perform basic math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

It shows how Python works with:
- Variables
- User input
- Data types (`int`, `float`)
- f-strings for formatting

Another step forward in my CS journey 🚀


### Day 3 – Python Logic: Calculator with While Loop

- Built a smart calculator using `while`, `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Allowed user to perform multiple operations until they type `exit`
- Handled edge case: divide by 0 using `continue`



## Day 4 – Python Conditionals: Grade Evaluator 🧠

This script asks for a student’s marks in 5 subjects, calculates total and percentage, and evaluates the grade.

### Concepts Used:
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- `for` loops and list handling
- Type casting and `float` input
- Output formatting with f-strings

**Another level up in my CS journey 🚀**


# Day 5 – Loops and Lists: Guest List Tracker 📋

This Python script takes a number of guests from the user and collects their names in a list. Then, it prints a formatted guest list.

## Concepts Used:
- for loop
- Lists
- User input
- range()
- List appending
- Looping through lists

Another strong step forward in my CS journey 🚀


## Day 6 – Functions & Reusability: BMI Calculator ⚖️

This project uses two custom functions:
- `calculate_bmi(weight, height)` – returns BMI
- `interpret_bmi(bmi)` – returns BMI category

### Concepts Used:
- def and return
- Parameters and arguments
- Conditional logic
- f-string formatting

A powerful step into real-world, reusable coding! 🚀


# Day 7 – File Handling: Notes Manager 🧠

This Python script allows the user to write and save personal notes to a text file (`notes.txt`). It demonstrates basic file handling skills and is a practical example of real-world programming.

- Saves the notes to a file
- Reads and displays all saved notes

## Concepts Used:
- `open()` function
- File modes: `"w"`, `"a"`, `"r"`
- `write()` and `read()` methods
- `with` block for safer file handling

Another big step in my CS journey 🚀


# Day 8 – Python Dictionaries: Contact Book 📇

## Description
This Python script allows users to store and manage contacts in a dictionary.  
It supports adding, viewing, searching, and deleting contacts.

## Concepts Used:
- **Dictionaries** for storing data as key-value pairs
- Dictionary methods: `.get()`, `.items()`, and `del`
- Functions for modular code
- Loops and conditionals for menu navigation
- String formatting for clean output

## Features:
1. **Add Contact** – Store a new name and phone number
2. **View Contacts** – Display all saved contacts
3. **Search Contact** – Find a contact by name
4. **Delete Contact** – Remove a contact from the book
5. **Exit** – Quit the program

Another strong step forward in my CS journey 🚀


# Day 9 – API Requests: Live Weather App ☁️🌤

## Description
This Python script fetches live weather data from the **OpenWeather API** based on a city name input from the user.

## Concepts Used:
- **API requests** with `requests` module
- **JSON parsing** in Python
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Using **parameters** in HTTP requests
- Real-time data processing

## Features:
1. Get live temperature in °C
2. Show weather condition
3. Display humidity
4. Handle errors for invalid city names

Another big step toward building real-world applications 🌍


# Day 10 – Number Guessing Game 🎯

## Description
A fun interactive Python game where the user tries to guess the computer's random number in the fewest attempts possible.

## Concepts Learned:
- `random.randint()` for random numbers
- `while True` loops for continuous play
- `if/elif/else` for conditions
- Counting attempts with variables

## How to Play:
1. Run the script
2. Enter a guess between 1–50
3. Follow the hints until you guess correctly
4. See your score (number of attempts)


# Day 11 – Number Guessing Game 2.0 🎮

## Description
An upgraded interactive Python game where the user selects a difficulty level and tries to guess the computer's random number in limited attempts.

## Features:
- Difficulty Levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Replay option without restarting

## Concepts Learned:
- Functions (`def play_game()`)
- Input validation
- Loop control (`while True`, `break`)
- Variables for difficulty settings

## How to Play:
1. Run the script
2. Choose a difficulty level
3. Guess the number within limited attempts
4. Play again if you want!


# Day 12 – Python Password Generator 🔑

## Description
A Python script that generates strong random passwords using letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Features:
- User chooses password length
- Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Prevents too-short passwords
