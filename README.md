# Day 2 â€“ Python Basics ðŸ§ 

This script helps users:

- Enter two numbers
- Perform basic math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

It shows how Python works with:
- Variables
- User input
- Data types (`int`, `float`)
- f-strings for formatting

Another step forward in my CS journey ðŸš€


## Day 4 â€“ Python Conditionals: Grade Evaluator ðŸ§ 

This script asks for a studentâ€™s marks in 5 subjects, calculates total and percentage, and evaluates the grade.

### Concepts Used:
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- `for` loops and list handling
- Type casting and `float` input
- Output formatting with f-strings

**Another level up in my CS journey ðŸš€**

### Day 3 â€“ Python Logic: Calculator with While Loop

- Built a smart calculator using `while`, `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Allowed user to perform multiple operations until they type `exit`
- Handled edge case: divide by 0 using `continue`
