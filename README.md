# Day 2 – Python Basics 🧠

This script helps users:
- Input their name and age
- Enter two numbers
- Perform basic math: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division

It shows how Python works with:
- Variables
- User input
- Data types (`int`, `float`)
- f-strings for formatting

Another step forward in my CS journey 🚀


### Day 3 – Python Logic: Calculator with While Loop

- Built a smart calculator using `while`, `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Allowed user to perform multiple operations until they type `exit`
- Handled edge case: divide by 0 using `continue`



## Day 4 – Python Conditionals: Grade Evaluator 🧠

This script asks for a student’s marks in 5 subjects, calculates total and percentage, and evaluates the grade.

### Concepts Used:
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- `for` loops and list handling
- Type casting and `float` input
- Output formatting with f-strings

**Another level up in my CS journey 🚀**


# Day 5 – Loops and Lists: Guest List Tracker 📋

This Python script takes a number of guests from the user and collects their names in a list. Then, it prints a formatted guest list.

## Concepts Used:
- for loop
- Lists
- User input
- range()
- List appending
- Looping through lists

Another strong step forward in my CS journey 🚀


## Day 6 – Functions & Reusability: BMI Calculator ⚖️

This project uses two custom functions:
- `calculate_bmi(weight, height)` – returns BMI
- `interpret_bmi(bmi)` – returns BMI category

### Concepts Used:
- def and return
- Parameters and arguments
- Conditional logic
- f-string formatting

A powerful step into real-world, reusable coding! 🚀


# Day 7 – File Handling: Notes Manager 🧠

This Python script allows the user to write and save personal notes to a text file (`notes.txt`). It demonstrates basic file handling skills and is a practical example of real-world programming.

## What it does:
- Accepts notes from the user
- Saves the notes to a file
- Reads and displays all saved notes

## Concepts Used:
- `open()` function
- File modes: `"w"`, `"a"`, `"r"`
- `write()` and `read()` methods
- `with` block for safer file handling

Another big step in my CS journey 🚀
